I am currently a senior pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at PES University. At present, I am interning at the Indian Insitute of Science under the supervision of [Prof. Radhakant Padhi](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/radhakantpadhi/?page_id=2). My research focuses on the design of optimal controllers for effective radiotherapy. Previously, I was part of the [PES Centre For Intelligent Systems Lab](https://research.pes.edu/cis/) carrying out research work under the guidance of [Prof. Koshy George](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Koshy-George-2) in the field of Neural Network Control and Reinforcement Learning for Control Systems.   

My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Robust and Intelligent Control Systems. In particular, I am interested in designing controllers that are able to autonomously control a machine without any human interference.
